# Bi-onic

GitHubGameOff Game Jam game about a human-machine hybrid struggling to survive.

When your human body starts to break down, can you use your bionic enhancements to keep yourself alive, all while still managing to save the world?

Made using the Pyxel engine for Python, which I've fallen in love with: https://github.com/kitao/pyxel
